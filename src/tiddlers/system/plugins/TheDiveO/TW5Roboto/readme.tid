! Thanks To...

* Google for their free and open Roboto font family.

* [[Transfonter|https://transfonter.org/]] for the Roboto font conversion to WOFF and CSS Base64 embedding code. According to its own description, Transfonter is a "modern and simple css @font-face generator".

! Notes

* At this time, this plugin uses the older WOFF web font format instead of the newer and better compressing WOFF2. This is in order to achieve a better browser coverage; compare [[WOFF coverage|https://caniuse.com/#feat=woff]] with [[WOFF2 coverage|https://caniuse.com/#feat=woff2]].

* This plugin will always use its embedded Roboto font family, even if Roboto is installed locally. Learning from my experience with Font Awesome, this ensures that users always experience a consistent Roboto appearance as intended by the plugin and specific Wiki creators.
